    <releaseNotes>Moved Plugin Code, Unified CorePlugin and EditorPlugin, IPluginLoader Ownership
#CHANGE: Moved some internal plugin management code to its matching PluginManager implementation.
#CHANGE: Both CorePlugin and EditorPlugin now derive from a shared base class. 
#CHANGE: Both CorePluginManager and EditorPluginManager now derive from a shared PluginManager&lt;T&gt; class.
#CHANGE: CorePluginLoader no longer assumes ownership over the IPluginLoader it is provided with.
#FIX: Fixed a bug where resolving an editor plugin dependency could lead to loading the same Assembly twice.
#FIX: Fixed a bug where on-demand resolving a dependency between core plugins would lead to loading the dependency as a regular Assembly, not as a plugin. 
#ADD: Extended the AssemblyResolve unit test to check for this.
#CHANGE: Instead of providing a single callback in IPluginLoader.Init, the interface now defines events for others to subscribe.
#CHANGE: Moved around some backend interface definitions.
#ADD: Added unit tests for CorePluginManager.
#ADD: Added an early-out to ClearPlugins for cases where there are no plugins left to remove. 
#CHANGE: Moved some functionality from being hardcoded in CorePluginManager to being executed in event handlers, so CorePluginManager can be tested in isolation.
#CHANGE: Removed an unused internal static variable and replaced it with a function local.
#CHANGE: Avoided some potential null reference exceptions.
#CHANGE: Now using a clear PluginRemoving/Removed event API, rather than discard / cleanupafter.
#ADD: Added documentation for IPluginLoader
#ADD: Added more documentation to the CorePluginManager API. 
#ADD: Added some minor validation checks to CorePluginManager API calls.
#CHANGE: Extracted CorePluginManager class from static DualityApp functionality.
#CHANGE: When attempting to load a plugin that causes a TypeLoadException upon access, Duality is now able to recover gracefully.</releaseNotes>
