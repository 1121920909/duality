    <releaseNotes>Project View Bugfixes, PropertyEditor Bugfixes, Tweaks, Moved Font Import Code
#FIX: Fixed a recently introduced bug where deleting a file would sometimes not cause it to be removed from the project view. 
#CHANGE: Modified PathHelper.IsPathVisible behavior to return false for Unix-hidden file paths, i.e. paths that contain an item which begins with a dot. 
#REMOVE: Removed some old code from file event management that was no longer necessary.
#FIX: Fixed a bug where a specialized PropertyEditor was selected for an object that didn't have the matching type. 
#CHANGE: Improved performance of PropertyEditor lookups.
#ADD: Added an immutable FontMetric class for easier transfer of font metrics between classes and methods. 
#CHANGE: Font Glyph rendering now takes place entirely in the FontAssetImporter. 
#REMOVE: Removed the old editor extension methods for Font glyph rendering.
#CHANGE: The FontCharSet class is now read-only after construction.
#CHANGE: Moved / Renamed the former editor FontRenderGlyphCharSet to FontCharSet in the core.
#ADD: The AssetInfo editor now allows to edit custom user data as if they were regular properties.
#ADD: The AssetInfo editor now updated after export operations to account for changes in allowed actions and parameter updates. 
#ADD: Added a feedback sound when performing an export or import operation successfully using either of the two editor buttons. 
#ADD: Added more AssetManagement documentation.
#CHANGE: Improved ProjectView performance in cases where a lot of files are deleted or added at once. Still far from perfect, but to (sanely) implement the biggest improvement here would require FileEventManager events that directly report N files, rather than one file at a time. This is a significant breaking change and thus scheduled for later.
#ADD: Added RecycleBin API to perform operations with N files at once, rather than one file at a time.
#ADD: Added global editor events that are fired when a public import or export operation has been performed.
#CHANGE: Added a note to the AssetManager regarding its relation to using asset operation classes directly.
#ADD: Added an API for parameter retrieval to the import / export environment. 
#ADD: Added custom data attachments to the AssetInfo class. 
#ADD: Implemented parameter retrieval API using the new custom data attachments as a backend.
#CHANGE: Moved GetSourceMediaBaseDir helper methods to a static helper class to keep the AssetManager class a clean single-purpose place.
#ADD: Added some null-or-whitespace parameter checks to Asset Environment API.
#ADD: Imported Resources now keep explicit source file hints in their AssetInfo, which are used to determine their corresponding source media file paths. Simulated export operations are used as a fallback. 
#CHANGE: The AssetInfo name hint property is no longer serialized, as it is considered temporary.
#ADD: Added more documentation to the AssetManager class. 
#CHANGE: Refactored the AssetManager class a little bit in preparation of dealing with issue 
#319
#CHANGE: Updated to AdamsLair.WinForms 1.1.4
