    <releaseNotes>TilemapTool Settings, Improved Tile API, AutoTile Resolve Tweaks, Bugfixes
#ADD: Added an API for providing per-TilemapTool editor settings that the user can specify and edit. 
#ADD: Added a setting for specifying how to apply AutoTiling logic.
#ADD: Added various Tile constructors for different ways to initialize a tile. 
#ADD: Wrote docs for each Tile constructor.
#CHANGE: Tweaked Tile ResolveIndex API. 
#FIX: Fixed inconsistent AutoTile index resolve code between resolve-only and updating AutoTile connectivity states as well.
#ADD: Added AutoTilePaintMode enum, as well as the EditTilemapAction's ability to properly handle it. 
#CHANGE: Compiled AutoTile data now includes the same per-tile information as used in the AutoTile input, instead of just the connectivity state. 
#CHANGE: The tiles that are provided by the SourcePaletteTilesetView are now pre-initialized with their Tileset's matching connectivity state. 
#CHANGE: Resolving AutoTile indices will no longer touch tiles that already have a matching connectivity state.
#ADD: Tile connectivity is now properly integrated into Undo / Redo operations.
#ADD: When drawing an AutoTile in the tilemap editor, it will now update all affected AutoTiles.
#FIX: Fixed a bug where losing focus and forcing a mouse leave event while performing an operation would result in a null reference exception.
#ADD: Added a Tile constructor that sets index and base index to the same value, now using it instead of the assignment new. 
#ADD: Added lots of documentation in comments and XML docs. 
#CHANGE: When serializing TilemapData, only tile base index and connectivity state are serialized. 
#CHANGE: Modified Tile struct to distinguish between index and base index. 
#CHANGE: Modified TileInfo.AutoTileLayer to be a one-based index, so the default zero will be equivalent to not referring an AutoTile layer at all. 
#REMOVE: Removed GenerateMissingTiles option from AutoTile input until it's actually implemented.</releaseNotes>
