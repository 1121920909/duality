    <releaseNotes>RigidBody Shape Layer Polygon Internals, RigidBody Joint Layer Angle Display Tweaks, RigidBody Joint Layer Line Width
#ADD: The RigidBody shape layer now displays internal polygon decomposition lines.
#CHANGE: Adjusted second angle constraint display to account for fixed-screen-size rendering.
#CHANGE: Now rendering RigidBody joint constraints using lines with an actual width for better readability.
#CHANGE: The RigidBody Joint layer visualization now renders using screen-space scaling.
#FIX: Fixed alpha value propagation, so joints can now be displayed half-transparent again when out of focus.
#CHANGE: All RigidBody related layer rendering is now fixed to the Z-0 plane, because that's where all physics takes place.
#REMOVE: Removed all text display from the RigidBody joint layer.
#CHANGE: Replaced all material switches in RigidBody Joint Layer with vertex-based color tints.
#FIX: Fixed a bug that caused axis locks to be offset when placing new vertices based on old ones.
#CHANGE: Adjusted highlight behaviour for RigidBody shapes based on selection.
#CHANGE: Right-click deselects the current tool even if an action hasn't been started with it yet.
#FIX: Shape visualization no longer scales outline thickness with object scale factor. 
#CHANGE: Now using explicit depth offsets for outlines to make sure they're always required to be in front of the filled polygon shapes.
#FIX: Polygon shapes can now be applied when hovering an unplaced vertex in a position that would make the polygon invalid. 
#FIX: Fixed polygon shapes becoming invalid while editing due to the fact that the next vertex starts off where the last one was placed.
#CHANGE: The RigidBody Editor state now by default activates the background plate layer.
#ADD: Added various polygon decomposition checks to ensure that no exceptions or invalid polygons are generated. 
#ADD: Added editor-specific checks to make sure a vertex that would make a valid polygon impossible can not be placed.
#FIX: Fixed an exception in the RigidBody shape layer when attempting to render a polygon shape that is invalid.
#CHANGE: Adjusted shape outline width.
#CHANGE: Tweaked shape overlay colors to fit both dark and bright color schemes.
#ADD: The RigidBody shape layer can now display non-convex polygons. 
#CHANGE: Improved the overall rendering style of the RigidBody shape layer.
#CHANGE: Adjusted RigidBodyEditor to no longer enforce former polygon shape constraints.</releaseNotes>
